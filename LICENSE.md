**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025 (Revision 3.2)  
**Owner:** CatMan6112  

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1 “Work”  
All source code, design, content, media, assets, and documentation in this repository (including all past and future commits), and all builds, compilations, generated artifacts, and derivative formats (e.g., minified JavaScript, HTML/CSS bundles, container images).  **Work** also includes any direct or indirect transformations, translations, conversions, or derivative works (e.g., transpilation, language conversions, format shifts) of any portion thereof, however created.

### 1.2 “Fork”  
Any repository containing the Work or its history—whether created via GitHub’s official “Fork” button or API, by manually duplicating or cloning the git history, by rebase, import, or any other mechanism—regardless of hosting platform.

### 1.3 “Deploy,” “Host,” or “Serve”  
To publish, mirror, distribute, display, stream, serve, embed, link to, hot-link, frame, cache, proxy, or otherwise make the Work (or any part thereof, in source or build form) available to any third party or over any network, platform, CDN, or proxy (including GitHub Pages, “github.io” subdomains, jsDelivr, UNPKG, Cloudflare Workers, or similar services).

### 1.4 “Copy” or “Reproduction”  
Any duplication of the Work by any means, including `git clone`, download, manual transcription, OCR, reverse-engineering, decompilation, or any automated or manual process.

### 1.5 “Use”  
Any reproduction, distribution, public display, execution, compilation, interpretation, creation of derivative works, deployment, or other utilization of the Work in any form.

## 2. Grant of License

Notwithstanding any platform terms (including GitHub’s Terms of Service) or statutory exceptions, Owner grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, royalty-free license to:

### 2.1 View or Browse  
View or browse the Work via GitHub’s web interface, API, or `git clone` solely for reading and inspecting the source without executing, deploying, or hosting it.

### 2.2 Fork on GitHub  
Create Forks on GitHub, provided each Fork remains strictly on GitHub, retains this License file unmodified in its root, and preserves Owner’s copyright.

> **No other rights are granted.** All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Owner.

## 3. Restrictions

Without Owner’s prior written permission, you may not:

1. **Copy, mirror, distribute, host, embed, link to, or serve** the Work (in source or any build form) on any platform or domain—including via any third-party CDN, cache, or proxy—or on any “github.io” or similar subdomain.  
2. **Execute, compile, interpret, run, or deploy** the Work in any environment (including serverless, containers, SaaS, PaaS).  
3. **Decompile, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works** (including de minimis modifications, transformations for interoperability, or any translation) without explicit permission—even where statutory interoperability or fair-use exceptions might apply.  
4. **Use the Work for commercial purposes** or incorporate it into any service, product, or API.  
5. **Incorporate any part of the Work into AI/ML training datasets** or automated processing beyond search-engine indexing as permitted in Section 2.1.  
6. **Grant sublicenses, assign, transfer, or otherwise convey** any of the foregoing rights.

### 3.7 Immediate Injunctive Relief for Hosting Breaches  
Any breach of § 3.1 (unauthorized hosting/deployment) is non-curable. Owner may seek immediate injunctive relief, without notice or cure period, to remove or disable access to any such unauthorized copies or deployments.

## 4. Click-Wrap and No Implicit Licenses

This License is the complete and exclusive statement of your rights to the Work. Any attempt to bind Owner to additional or different terms (e.g., via GitHub UI, pull requests, or click-wrap offerings) is void. No other rights—statutory or otherwise—are granted or waived.

## 5. Notice and Termination

### 5.1 Notice of Breach  
Owner may provide written notice specifying any breach of Sections 2 or 3.

### 5.2 Cure Period  
Except as set forth in § 3.7 for hosting breaches, you have thirty (30) days from notice delivery to cure the breach and confirm in writing that you have done so.

### 5.3 Termination  
If you fail to cure within the applicable period, this License (and all rights granted herein) terminates automatically. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Work and delete all copies—public and private—including build artifacts and Forks.

## 6. Remedies

Owner may seek injunctive relief, damages, costs of enforcement, and any other remedies available at law or in equity.

## 7. Governing Law and Venue

This License is governed by the laws of Illinois, USA. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any dispute shall lie in the state or federal courts in Madison County, Illinois.
