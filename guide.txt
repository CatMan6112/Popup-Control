"mode":
 Can either be "once" or "manual"
   Manual gives direct control over when it shows up, so as long as the "enabled" value is set to true, it shows up on the page until closed.

"dismissible":
 Allows the user to close it.
  Setting it to false removes the ability for an close button. Why you would use it? Beyond me.

"Start":
 Sets time for popup to start appearing

"End":
 Sets time for popup to start disappearing

"Path":
 Allows where a popup can show

"frequencyDays":
 0 = never seeing it again for same id,
 >0 = seeing it X days after seeing it.
  e.g. 2, would mean you would see the popup again after closing it or seeing it 2 days ago.

"sessionRespect":
 True = saving having the popup closed for the entire browser session.
 False = Comes back on every page reload
